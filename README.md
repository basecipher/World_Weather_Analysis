# World_Weather_Analysis

Written with Python

## Overview of Project

Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers love it too. And, as with any new product, they’ve recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data you’ve already retrieved in this module. Then, you'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby 

### Purpose
1: Retrieve Weather Data
2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map


## Resources

* Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.50.1

* Data Source:  several starter codes

## Summary
* The correlation between the latitude and percent humidity is very low because the r-value is less than 0.04 for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres for the plots shown here. This means that percent humidity is unpredictable due to changing weather patterns that can increase or decrease percent humidity. Check the r-values for your plots. 
* The correlation between the latitude and percent cloudiness is very low because the r-value is less than –0.09 for the Northern Hemisphere and less than –0.02 for the Southern Hemisphere for the plots shown here.
